# DL-for-PD-Detection
Using slices of the substantia nigra, we created multiple Deep Learning models to detect Parkinson's Disease. We also used  a speech feature dataset to develop ML algorithms for classification. 
The Notebooks are in steps going from augmentation, to cropping, to model creation, to model test.
